Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Baylor University. 

I use experimental methods and behavioral economics to study questions related to the economics of innovation. My current research focuses on uncovering how individuals resolve the exploration versus exploitation trade-off and how to design mechanisms to increase innovation. My research interests lie at the intersection of experimental economics, industrial organization, game theory, and behavioral economics.
